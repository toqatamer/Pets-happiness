# Pets-happiness
A web application with web interfaces (Doctor, Nurse) which needs to be with the new interfaces (Patient, Pharmacy, Imaging lab) that aims to address the major problems faced by animal owners and helpers during medication consultation. The system provides an easy booking process, on-time appointments, electronic prescriptions, and easy access to medications. The application also includes an accommodation feature and an available x-ray slot for animals. Physicians benefit from a view of pet information, write prescriptions, and access pet x-ray reports. This system is implemented using C# to make frontend design and backend by MVC and connected with SQL for creating the system database. This system offers a user-friendly interface with an organized flow that allows the user to view the consultation time and view the prescription ordered from the integrated pharmacy. This application is expected to facilitate the medication consultation process for animal owners and helpers and provide better care for animals.
